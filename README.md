Collect, refine, Vote -> iteration-0

Voting tools:

- https://quadraticvote.radicalxchange.org/ easy, needs no token, links easily shared; QV can be irritating
- https://tokenlog.xyz/alasdao/OpenGuitar needs creation of a token (can be on testnet); voting items are github issues 
- https://www.slido.com/ - Just a sli.do poll, just counting thumbs-up === one-person-one-vote ; not sure if voters need slido account
